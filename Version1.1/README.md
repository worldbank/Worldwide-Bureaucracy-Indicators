# Version 1.1

Version 1.1, released in June 2020, extended WWBIâ€™s coverage to previously underrepresented regions using new primary data sources, updated temporal coverage to 2018 and made methodological improvements by transforming premiums resulting from wage regressions to their more precise specification; added additional indicators reflecting the statistical significance (p-values) for these premium regressions; and amended the quality thresholds set out in version 1.0 for the selection of surveys for inclusion.
