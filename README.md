The Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators (WWBI) is a unique cross-national dataset on public sector employment and wages developed by the World Bank's Bureaucracy Lab to better enable researchers, development practitioners, and policymakers to identify and implement evidenced-based reforms. Indicators within the WWBI cover five dimensions of the public sector workforce: the size and demographics of the private and public sector workforces; public sector wage premium, gender pay gaps; pay compression ratios; and the public sector wage bill.
