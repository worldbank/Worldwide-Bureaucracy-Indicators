# Worldwide-Bureaucracy-Indicators

The Worldwide Bureaucracy Indicators (WWBI) is a unique cross-national dataset on public sector employment and wages developed by the World Bank's Bureaucracy Lab to better enable researchers, development practitioners, and policymakers to identify and implement evidenced-based reforms. Indicators within the WWBI cover five dimensions of the public sector workforce: the size and demographics of the private and public sector workforces; public sector wage premium, gender pay gaps; pay compression ratios; and the public sector wage bill.


A few key Indicators:

-Size of the public and private sector workforce
-Demographics of public and private sector employment: distributions by gender, age, education, urban-rural, wage quintiles, and industry of employment
-Gender equity in public and private sectors
-Public sector wage premiums 
-Distributions of public sector wage premiums by education,  occupation, industry, and gender
-Gender pay gaps in the public and private sectors
-Pay compression ratios in  public and private sectors (ratio of 90th and 10th percentile wage earners)
-Pay compression ratios in the public and private sector (indexed occupations)
-Presence of social safety nets in the public and private sectors
-The relative size of the public sector wage bill
